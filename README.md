## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<dl>
  <dt>Can I build my design from Assignment 01?</dt>
  <dd>Yes! That's a great idea.</dd>
  
  <dt>What type and style of web page do I have to build?</dt>
  <dd>You can build anything you want that meets the content requirements. If you want to build a portfolio site - go for it! If you want to build the home page of an e-commerce store - that's cool too!</dd>
  
  <dt>Does the web page have to work in both mobile and desktop</dt>
  <dd>No! You may build either a mobile or a desktop version of your web page. You may build a responsive web page if you would like but it is not a requirement for this assignment.</dd>
 
  <dt>Can I use lorem ipsum text in my webpage</dt>
  <dd>You may use lorem ipsum if you need to but for this assignment try to use relevant content. Though, if you don't have relevant content you are absolutely permitted to use <a href="https://www.lipsum.com">lorem ipsum</a>, <a href="https://baconipsum.com">bacon ipsum</a>, or <a href="https://veganipsum.me">vegan ipsum</a> in your designs. Keep in mind that this should not be used in cases where the meaning of the text is important, for example the call to action buttons in the hero.</dd>

  <dt>Do I need to include sketches, concepts, or initial low fidelity mockups in the report</dt>
  <dd>No. If you would like to share your design or creative process I'm happy to look at them, but it is not required.</dd>
