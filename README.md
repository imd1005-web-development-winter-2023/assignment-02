|HTML|**30%**|The HTML code submitted is well formed, structured, commented, and complaint. Appropriate semantic elements are used throughout the document. For example, use `<header>` for the page header and `<section>` for each document section within `<main>`. Correct use of headings `<h1-h6>` and heading structure. The web page has the appropriate meta tags in teh `<head>` to set the charset and viewport values.|
